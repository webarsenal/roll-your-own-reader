Roll Your Own Reader

This project was developed for fun as a proof of concept. I wanted an RSS reader that could be used anywhere such as a hosted website, in Dropbox or just be ran from a computer. Pretty much anywhere you can run html, css and JavaScript. So here you go.

It is recommended that you use a modern HTML5 compatible browser such as Chrome. Features may not work as well or at all on older browsers.

Mobile

The reader is built using repsonsive design in order to support any size screen. Swiping left or right can be used to show/hide the articles on browsers that support gestures.

Adding RSS Feeds

1 - Open index.html in your favorite text editor
2 - Find the html comment <!-- Add your feeds here -->
3 - Add anchor tags with href's to any rss feed
	IE: <a href="http://www.digg.com/rss/index.xml">Digg Top Stories</a>
	
Viewing from your computer

1 - Simply download the files to your computer.
2 - Open index.html
	It is important to know that the assets directory must be in the same directory as the index file

Viewing from Dropbox

1 - Upload the files to your dropbox account
2 - Copy the public link and paste into your browser
